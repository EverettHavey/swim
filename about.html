            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Swim & Earn was founded in 2025 with a simple yet powerful vision: to encourage healthy lifestyles and reward individuals for their dedication to fitness, specifically through swimming. Recognizing the commitment and effort required to swim laps regularly, we wanted to create a platform that not only motivates swimmers but also provides tangible benefits for their hard work.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that every lap counts, not just for personal health but also for contributing to a broader understanding of aquatic wellness. By incentivizing swimmers to track their activity, we aim to gather valuable data that can be used for research and to promote the benefits of swimming across communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our journey began with a small team of fitness enthusiasts and technology innovators who shared a passion for swimming and a desire to make a positive impact. Today, Swim & Earn is a growing community of swimmers who are turning their workouts into rewards, one lap at a time.
